  <p>My research focuses on the physical behavior of biological and soft matter systems under confinement and crowding. I investigate how polymers, chromatin, and gels organize and diffuse in constrained environments, using a combination of computational modeling and statistical physics approaches.</p>

  <p>Key areas of my research include:</p>
  
  make a post about hydrogels
  make a post about polymeric gel
  make a post about colloidal gel
  make a post about auxeticy in stem cell
  make a post about confined polymers
  make a post about the crowder polymer interaction 
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Polymer and Chromatin Physics:</strong> Understanding chromatin compaction, auxeticity, and the influence of epigenetic landscapes on stem cells, as well as polymer behavior near attractive surfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Crowded Environments:</strong> Studying diffusion and dynamics in crowded and grafted cylindrical tubes, and how confinement affects structural and dynamical properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Soft Matter Simulations:</strong> Modeling gels and other complex fluids to explore mechanical response, structural organization, and dynamics using molecular dynamics simulations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>My work combines insights from theoretical models and simulations to uncover fundamental principles governing the behavior of crowded and confined systems. You can explore my publications for detailed studies in these areas.</p>
